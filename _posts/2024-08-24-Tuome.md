The first two dishes featured in the photos are appetisers.  
The first one had an intriguing texture chewy satisfying. Delicate flakes were sprinkled on top of a layer of cheese, and the combination of the cheese, the flakes, and the texture of the main ball a harmonious and delightful experience for the palete.  

The second one is a signature appetiser: egg.  
What truly amazed me about this dish was how it transformed completely ordinary ingredients into something extraordinary.  At its core, it's simply a boiled egg, but what sets it apart is the way it's prepared.  
The boiled egg is coated in a crispy, fried batter, giving it a satisfying crunch.  
The creamy topping added a rich, flavourful layer, elevating the humble egg into a culinary masterpiece.  
It was a moment where a simple egg become something truly special.
