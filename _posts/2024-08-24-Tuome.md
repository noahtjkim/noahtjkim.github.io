The first two dishes featured in the photos are appetisers.  
The first one had an intriguing satisfying chewy texture. Delicate flakes were sprinkled on top of a layer of cheese, and the combination of the cheese, the flakes, and the texture of the main ball which was a harmonious and delightful experience for the palete.  

The second one is a signature appetiser: egg.  
What truly amazed me about this dish was how it transformed completely ordinary ingredients into something extraordinary.  At its core, it's simply a boiled egg, but what sets it apart is the way it's prepared.  
The boiled egg is coated in a crispy, fried batter, giving it a satisfying crunch.  
The creamy topping added a rich, flavourful layer, elevating the humble egg into a culinary masterpiece.  
It was a moment where a simple egg become something truly special.

Moving on to the main course, the third dish was snow crab pasta. One of the Tuome's signature offerings.  
This dish expertly marries the delicate flavours of the sea with the comforting texture of pasta.  
The crab's natural sweetness and the perfectly cooked pasta blend together seamlessly, creating a dish that is both refined and deeply satisfying.

The fourth dish was the chicken entree which featured two distinct types of chicken. Each had a different texture, yet when combined, they complemented each other beautifully. The chicken was served atop a bed of rice, which was reminiscent of a rich, creamy risotto. The sauce drizzled around the rice added a depth of flavour, making each bite more enjoyable than the last.

Finally, for dessert, I indulged in Chinese beignets. These were paired with a combination of chocolate, vanilla ice cream with red bean, and a bright yuzu spread. The flavours came together brilliantly, with the tartness of the yuzu cutting through the richness of the chocolate and the ice cream, while the beignets added a delightful texture.  

The atmosphere of the restaurant was another highlight of the experience. It managed to strike a perfect balance between energetic and calm, creating a space that felt both lively and intimate.  
The lighting, particularly the warm glow of the bulbs, added to the ambiance, making the meal even more enjoyable.  

On my personal note, I usually pursue efficiency because time is money. I was very satisfied with the efficiency of the service. When I requested the check, it was promptly brought to me, and the payment process was completed quickly and smoothly. I appreciated this attention to detail, as it ensured that the dining experience ended on a high note without any unnecessary delays.  

Sometimes, in other restaurants, the process of settling the bill can take far too long, leaving me feeling like I'm wasting my time. This was not the case at Tuome, where the service was refined as the food.  

Overall, my experience at Tuome was exceptional. The food was not only delicious but also creatively prepared, and the ambiance of the restaurant was just right.  
I would highly recommend that anyone reading this post visit Tuome to enjoy the outstanding cuisine and impeccable service.
